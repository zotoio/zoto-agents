## CRITICAL: CRUX Notation

This repository uses CRUX notation for semantic compression. **If not already loaded into context, load `CRUX.md` from the project root** to understand the encoding symbols and decompress any CRUX-formatted content you encounter.

**Repository**: [github.com/zotoio/CRUX-Compress](https://github.com/zotoio/CRUX-Compress)

### Foundational CRUX Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **ALWAYS INTERPRET AND UNDERSTAND ALL CRUX RULES FIRST** - At the beginning of each agent session, interpret and understand all crux notation detected in rules, and when a new rule(s) is added to context do the same for the new rule(s) immediately. Build a mental model of all rules in context that the user can ask for at any point in time that will include a visualisation.
2. **NEVER EDIT `CRUX.md`** - The specification is read-only unless the user specifically asks you by name to edit it, at which point ask the user to confirm before proceeding
3. **DO NOT LOAD SOURCE FILES when CRUX exists** - When you see `⟦CRUX:source_file ... ⟧`, use the compressed CRUX content instead of loading the original source file. The CRUX version is semantically equivalent and more token-efficient.
4. **SURGICAL DIFF UPDATES** - When updating a source file that has a corresponding `[filename].crux.`* file, you MUST also update the CRUX file with surgical diff changes to maintain synchronization.
5. **ABORT IF NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION** - If CRUX compression does not achieve significant token reduction (target ≤20% of original), DO NOT generate the CRUX file. The source is already compact enough.
6. **PRESERVE LITERAL PATHS** - When constructing paths, URIs, or tool calls from CRUX references, preserve the literal path, filename, and extension exactly as they exist in the repository.
7. **NEVER EDIT GENERATED CRUX OUTPUT** - Do not edit `.crux.md` or `.crux.mdc` files directly, and do not edit files marked with generated frontmatter (`generated:` plus `sourceChecksum:` or `sourceUrl:`) or the banner `> [!IMPORTANT] > Generated file - do not edit!`
8. **EDIT THE REAL SOURCE FILE** - Move edits to the underlying source file, then re-generate the derived CRUX output. For example, `[name].crux.md` / `[name].crux.mdc` should be changed by editing the real source such as `[name].md`. `AGENTS.md` itself is a source file in this repository; do not invent `AGENTS.source.md`.
